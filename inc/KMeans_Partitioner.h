 *
 * Description: This class runs Lloyd's Algorithm for k-means clustering to form partitions.
 * The algorithm uses the centroids of the depot/terminal pairs as the initial partition centroids.
 * It only runs for a set number of iterations as opposed to running until the clusters settle.
 * This is meant to prevent the algorithm from shifting the partitions too far away from the
 * depot/terminal centroids.
 *
 * Thanks to Robert Andrew Martin for giving a great explanation on Lloydâ€™s algorithm and for making
 * his code publicly available. This implementation is a modification of his work.
